# Open Science OER Toolkit & Open Research Assessment

## Project Overview

The **Open Science OER Toolkit & Open Research Assessment** project develops an Open Educational Resource (OER) toolkit designed to support a cultural shift in research assessment. The initiative is aligned with the principles of the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} (CoARA) and contributes to broader international efforts to reform how research quality and impact are evaluated.

The toolkit equips:

- Early Career Researchers (ECRs)  
- Principal Investigators (PIs)  
- Research managers and institutional leaders  

with the knowledge, frameworks, and practical tools needed to implement **responsible research assessment** and **open science practices** across diverse research environments.

At its core, the project promotes:

- Recognition of diverse research contributions and career paths  
- Qualitative evaluation approaches  
- Peer review as a central evaluative practice  
- Responsible and contextualised use of metrics  

The toolkit explicitly discourages the inappropriate use of journal- and publication-based indicators (e.g., Journal Impact Factor, h-index) in line with international reform movements.


## What the Toolkit Includes

Developed in collaboration with the :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}, the toolkit provides:

- 📘 Interactive training guides  
- 💻 Online learning modules  
- 🌍 Real-world case studies  
- 🎥 Video-based learning resources  

These materials are designed to build both **individual and institutional capacity** in open science and responsible research assessment.

### Core Topics Covered

- Open Science principles  
- Open research cultures  
- Responsible research assessment  
- Research data management  
- Open data practices  
- FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)  
- Data stewardship  

The toolkit is intentionally designed for **scalability and adaptability**, enabling adoption across:

- Different institutional types  
- Multiple disciplines  
- National and international research systems  


## Alignment and Impact

This initiative directly supports the commitments of CoARA and aligns with the :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} Recommendation on Open Science.

By fostering responsible, inclusive, and transparent assessment practices, the project:

- Strengthens institutional readiness for open science mandates  
- Supports long-term research culture change  
- Encourages recognition of diverse research outputs and societal contributions  
- Promotes integrity, transparency, and equity in research evaluation  


## Target Audience

- Early Career Researchers  
- Principal Investigators  
- Research development professionals  
- Institutional leadership  
- Policy-makers involved in research governance  


## Funding Acknowledgement

This project has received funding from the **European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme** under Grant Agreement No. **101131826**.


## Towards Open Science

The Open Science OER Toolkit contributes to building a more responsible, inclusive, and transparent research ecosystem — one that values quality, openness, collaboration, and diverse forms of scholarly contribution.
